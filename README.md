# Shoot the Messenger

Shoot the Messenger is a Chrome extension that automatically unsends every message you have in a messenger chain. Open a messenger thread, hit 'Remove Messages', and go get a coffee. While you're gone, the extension will click on every 'unsend message' button, leaving behind a trail of nothing.

The extension is currently waiting approval on the Web Store. In the meantime, you can git clone the repo and install it as an unpacked extension. You can see how here: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/getstarted/
