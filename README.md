# Shoot the Messenger

Shoot the Messenger is a Chrome extension that automatically unsends every message you have in a messenger chain. Open a messenger thread, hit 'Remove Messages', and go get a coffee. While you're gone, the extension will click on every 'unsend message' button, leaving behind a trail of nothing.

This extension will remove your messages, but it will also delete the messages of everyone else in the messenger chain. I HIGHLY recommend backing up your messenger data before using this extension.

The extension is currently waiting approval on the Web Store. In the meantime, you can git clone the repo and install it as an unpacked extension. You can see how here: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/getstarted/

NOTE: while for the most part unsending messages does not result in notifications for the other party, some iPhone users reported getting a lot of notifications as messages were being removed. The content of the message was not present. Specifically, I've had friends with Messenger v291.2+ on iPhone getting notifications when messages are removed. Unfortunately, because of the nature of Shoot the Messenger, this can result in a lot of inadvertent spam sent to Facebook friends. As far as I can tell, notifications are NOT sent if you are removing messages from a thread where the other person is NOT your facebook friend. None of this applies to android users.

NOTE: not all messages can be unsent. For example, I've been unable to remove some messages with links in them, and stickers give a lot of trouble. This isn't a problem with the extension, so much as a problem with Facebooks removal backend.
