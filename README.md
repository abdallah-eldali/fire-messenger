# Shoot the Messenger

Shoot the Messenger is a Chrome extension that automatically unsends every message you have in a messenger chain. Open a messenger thread, hit 'Remove Messages', and go get a coffee. While you're gone, the extension will click on every 'unsend message' button, leaving behind a trail of nothing.

The extension is currently waiting approval on the Web Store. In the meantime, you can git clone the repo and install it as an unpacked extension. You can see how here: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/getstarted/

NOTE: while for the most part unsending messages does not result in notifications for the other party, some iPhone users reported getting a lot of notifications as messages were being removed. The content of the message was not present. It's not clear when this happens or why -- some users report getting the notifications, some do not. Use at your own risk.

Specifically, users with Messenger v291.2+ on iPhone have reported getting notifications when messages are removed.
