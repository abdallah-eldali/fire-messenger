# remove-fb-messenger
Script to auto-unsend all messages from a facebook messenger chat.

Tested in chrome. 

HOWTO:

Run the little function in remove-messages.js in a chrome dev console by copy pasting the function in, then calling the function by typing unsendAllVisibleMessages().

Depending on how long the message chain is, it may take a while...consider leaving it running over night. Eventually if you come back and you've reached the top of the message chain, you can refresh the page to stop the script.
