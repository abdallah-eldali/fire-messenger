## Not all messages are being removed -- being deleted by previous runs before
the remove buttons are clicked?

This is caused by the loadmore button being pressed at the end of a run,
     after which the next search is selected which may be above a message I sent
     that had not yet been removed


## If a search has a lot of possible hits (> 20?) it doesnt properly resolve to
     use a different search option. Instead, system tries to keep going, which
     results in a cryptic failure down the line.
